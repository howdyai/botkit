# Provisioning Botkit
As Botkit adds more platforms, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of all the methods for provisioning your bot on the various platforms we support.

To help Botkit developers, we are pulling out detailed provisioning documents for each platform and keeping them in this directory. Our hope is that this will make our docs more flexible to platform changes, and clearly show the fastest way to stand up your bot!

### [Microsoft Teams](teams.md)

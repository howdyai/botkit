# 4.5

We're skipping a few version numbers here to keep in sync with the rest of [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework).
Welcome to Botkit 4.5!  This release contains a host of improvements and bug fixes affecting Botkit's conversation system, as well the behavior
of some of the platform adapters.  We recommend that all developers currently using Botkit v4 upgrade to 4.5. 

Specific Changes: 

* NEW: It is now possible to create dynamic quick replies, and attachments within a BotkitConversation. [See full docs](https://botkit.ai/docs/v4/conversations.html#dynamic-quick-replies-and-attachments).
* NEW: Previously, there was no way to bind middleware to the internally created Express webserver. It is now possible to do so using the `webserver_middlewares` parameter.  [Full docs](https://botkit.ai/docs/v4/reference/slack.html#interface-slackadapteroptions)
* NEW: Quick replies and suggestedActions are now procssed as mustache templates. Thanks to [@InnoraG](https://github.com/innorag) for [the pull request](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1731).
* NEW: Slack block actions and other button clicks now are message type events and get included in dialogs. Thanks to [@apemberton](https://github.com/apemberton) for the [pull request](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1712).
* NEW: The key name passed in to convo.ask and convo.addQuestion can now be set to null in order to discard the answer. Thanks to [@adantoscano](https://github.com/adantoscano) for [the pull request](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1716)


* FIX: Botkit will no longer improperly prune platform specific fields like quick replies and attachments specified inside BotkitConversations. [Fix for #1664](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/issues/1664), [#1679](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/issues/1679), and [#1699](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/issues/1699).
* FIX: The text field in BotkitConversations was expected to always be an array, causing some confusion. It is now possible to pass in a string OR an array. Passing an array will cause Botkit to choose a random entry in the array for the message text.
* FIX: Several updates have been made to the middleware pipeline so that it better matches expected behavior.  The receive and send middlewares will now fire for every incoming message - previously, there were cases where these would not fire. Thanks to [@adantoscano](https://github.com/adantoscano) for [this pull request](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1717) and also [this one](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1720). 
* FIX: The method for passing in a URI for communicating with Botkit CMS has been made more reliable, thanks to [@adantoscano](https://github.com/adantoscano). [See #1675](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1675) and [#1677](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1677).
* FIX: Webex adapter has been updated to better support file uploads. Thanks to [@Teamop](https://github.com/Teamop) for [the pull request](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1667)
* FIX: Improve mapping of Bot Framework "Activity" fields. Thanks to [@Naktibalda](https://github.com/Naktibalda) for [the pull request](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1707).
* FIX: Expand typedefs for Slack dialogs. Thanks to [@roger-king](https://github.com/roger-king) for [the pull request](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1653)

# 0.7.0

This release is the first major step towards [deprecating Botkit Studio](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/issues/1534),
and introducing a more general system for scripted dialogs and content from [Botkit CMS](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-cms).

We urge all Botkit users to update to the most recent version of Botkit. This may require an update to your project's package.json file.

* Remove all functionality pertaining to Botkit Studio statistics and analytics APIs. All stats related services provided by Botkit Studio will cease operation on Dec 15.
* Remove `stats_optout` flag from configuration.
* Remove Botkit Studio options from command line interface.
* Calls to Botkit Studio and/or Botkit CMS will no longer include the user's id

New features and changes:

* Many Facebook APIs [have been promisified](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1520) by @htaidirt
* Improved technique used to verify incoming webhooks from Slack [use hmac compare instead of direct compare](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1539) - Thanks, @danhofer!

# 0.6.20

* Fix bug introduced in 0.6.19 that caused events to improperly fire twice.
* Emit a warning if Slack webhook validation is not enabled.
* To prepare for upcoming changes to Botkit Studio and Botkit stats collection:

# 0.6.19

No new features, but updates throughout the dependency tree for security and stability purposes.

* Updated dependency versions to latest available

* Rewrote Botkit command line tool to remove dependency on abandoned library. Upgrade to the latest: `npm install -g botkit`

* Switched from using jscs to eslint for linting purposes.

# 0.6.18

* Fix syntax error in Web connector. Oops! Thanks for reporting this issue @iworkforthem!

* Add support for Google Hangouts "card_clicked" event. [Thanks to @ouadie-lahdioui](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1487)

# 0.6.17

In addition to minor fixes, dependency version updates, and documentation updates, this version includes:

* Google Hangouts support is here! Thanks to [@ouadie-lahdioui's hard work](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1414), your bot can now operate in [Hangouts Chat](https://gsuite.google.com/products/chat/).

    Get started with the [Botkit Starter Kit for Google Hangouts](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-googlehangouts).

    [Botkit docs for Google Hangouts connector](https://botkit.ai/docs/readme-google-hangouts.html)

* CiscoSpark bots are now officially WebexBots. Everything is backwards compatible thanks to the hard work of [@ObjectIsAdvantag](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1349), but you should move to using `Botkit.webexbot()` instead of `Botkit.sparkbot()` ASAP.

    [Botkit docs for Cisco Webex Teams](https://botkit.ai/docs/readme-webex.html)

    [Read more about these changes](https://botkit.ai/docs/readme-webex.html#webex-rebrand).

* Tests have been reorganized and updated thanks to [@fastbean-au](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1468).

* Errors that occur in the middleware pipeline will now cause `pipeline_error` event to be emitted. In addition, errors at specific stages of the pipeline will also emit their own events: `ingest_error`, `normalize_error`, `categorize_error` and `receive_error`. This should make it easier to debug problems in middleware. Thanks to [@Nop0x](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1425).  [Docs](https://botkit.ai/docs/core.html#middleware-error-events)

    Handle a pipeline error:
    ```javascript
    controller.on('pipeline_error', function(err, bot, message, stage_name) {
        // ... handle it!
    });
    ```

    Handle a specific stage error:
    ```javascript
    controller.on('ingest_error', function(err, bot, message) {
        // ... handle it!
    });
    ```


# 0.6.16

* Fixed issue in Cisco adapter introduced in 0.6.15

# 0.6.15

BIG UPDATE:

[Botkit now works on the web!](docs/readme-web.md) The new web connector supports websocket and webhook connections for sending and receiving messages. The brand new [Botkit Anywhere starter kit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-web) includes a [customizable web chat client](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-web/blob/master/docs/botkit_web_client.md), and a [built-in chat server](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-web/blob/master/docs/botkit_chat_server.md).  Of course, this works with the existing stack of Botkit tools and plugins!

New for Botkit Studio:

Developers using Botkit Studio to create and manage script content can now utilize a new message action in their conditional statements, or at the end of any thread.
It is now possible to direct your bot to seamlessly transition to a different Botkit Studio script. This allows for new patterns like interconnected menus, loops and branching conversations.

New core features:

Developers can now exclude specific types of events from being included in conversations using `controller.excludeFromConversations(event_name)`.
This has been applied to the Facebook connector, which will now exclude certain events automatically. [Docs](docs/readme.md#excluding-events-from-conversations)

The tick interval used for driving conversations can now be adjusted using `controller.setTickDelay(ms)`.  [Docs](docs/readme.md#changing-the-speed-of-botkits-internal-tick)

## 0.6.0

This version features some BIG CHANGES!

**New platform support:**

[Microsoft Teams](docs/readme-teams.md) is now officially supported with its own connector, including new features in [Botkit Studio](https://studio.botkit.ai) like authoring of Teams-specific attachments, an app package builder and configuration manager, and [a new starter kit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-teams).

[Read the full docs for Botkit for Microsoft Teams](docs/readme-teams.md)

**Major changes to message handling code:**

[Introducing the Botkit Message Pipeline](docs/readme-pipeline.md), a formalized process for Botkit's handling of incoming and outgoing messages. All of the platform connectors have been refactored to use this new series of middleware functions, and are now implemented in a uniform way.

Developers who make use of Botkit's middleware system should [take time to read this update](docs/readme-pipeline.md). Most current middleware functions will  continue to work as expected, but mild changes may be desirable to update these functions to use Botkit's latest features.

In addition, developers who use third party middleware plugins should carefully retest their applications after upgrading to version 0.6, as these plugins may need to be updated for full compatibility.

**Upgrade Guide:**

This version of Botkit deprecates the `receive_via_postback` and `interactive_replies` options
that caused button clicks to be treated as typed messages.  These and other small changes to the way Botkit emits events may require minor updates to some Botkit apps.

[Upgrading from Botkit 0.5 or lower? Read this guide!](docs/howto/upgrade_05to06.md)


## 0.5.8
